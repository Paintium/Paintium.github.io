# Technology

We used Three.js, canvas and shaders (GLSL).
The demo was made with the help of the open source demo tool [nin](https://github.com/ninjadev/nin/), written in
JavaScript.

We tried to keep the demo lightweight, so it would run smoothly on a modern
mobile device. We tested it on a Sony Xperia XZ, where it ran smoothly, and a
Samsung Galaxy A3, where the FPS was below par.

Note: Please run the demo in Chrome, not in Firefox. In Firefox, there seems to
be something wrong with the synchronization between audio and visuals.

When you press the start button, the demo will try to put the browser in full screen mode.
